# Exercise 3: Integrate API Management with your Azure Functions

### Estimated Duration: 90 minutes

Here you use the Azure API Management (APIM) which is a powerful service for creating, securing, and managing APIs. It offers features like authentication, rate limiting, and IP filtering to ensure robust security and performance. APIM also provides developer portals for easy API documentation and testing, facilitating seamless integration for developers.

In this exercise, you'll integrate Azure API Management (APIM) with your Azure Functions to create a secure and manageable API. Specifically, you'll develop a function to retrieve driver license details and import this function into an APIM instance. Once imported, you'll expose this functionality as an API, securing it with a subscription key to control access. Additionally, you'll enhance security by configuring an IP filtering policy, ensuring that only authorized IP addresses can access the API. This setup demonstrates how to effectively manage and secure APIs using Azure's comprehensive API Management features.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a function to pull driver's license information
- Task 2: Import your Function App into API Management
- Task 3: Secure the API using Subscription Key and validate
- Task 4: Configure API policies (IP Filtering) and validate

   ![](media/ex3task6img3.png)

1. Copy the **Request URL** provided in the API test section and open it in a new browser tab to test the API endpoint.

   ![](media/ex3task6img4.png)

1. You will see **access denied**.This means your API is now secured. Now You need Subscription key to access your API. 

   ![](media/ex3task6img5.png)

1. Navigate to **Subscription** page from the left hand menu.

   ![](media/ex3task5img9.png)

1. You can see a precreated Subscription key called **Built-in all-access subscription**. This is a master key which works for all the API under this particular API Management service.But for now you will create a new subscription key for the API that you created. Click on **+Add subscription**.

   ![](media/ex3task5img10.png)

1. On the **New Subscription** form give the **Name(1)** as ```LicenseKeySub``` , Under **scope(2)** select **API** and Under **API(3)** select the API which is already created previously. Click on **Create(4)**.

   ![](media/ex3task4img1.png)

1. Your subscription will be created. You can view its keys by selecting the 3 dots on the rightmost of your subscription name, and choosing Show/hide keys to see the keys.

   ![](media/ex3task4img2.png)

1. Your keys will be visible. Copy the primary key using the Copy button.

   ![](media/ex3task4img3.png)

1. Goto the API Request URL in your browser and add the subscription key in the end, prior to the subscription-key query parameter, joining it with &. This query parameter will store the value of your subscription key, which is needed to access your API successfully.

   Your Request URL will look something like this:

   ```
   https://apiservice-1411123.azure-api.net/License-function-1411123/HttpTrigger1?id=7<ID>&subscription-key=<SUBSCRIPTION-KEY>
   ```
   >**Note**: Make sure to replace the `<ID>` and `<SUBSCRIPTION-KEY>` with the values you copies earlier.

1. You will be able to access your API successfully using the subscription key and the expected response will be displayed.

   ![](media/ex3task4img4.png)

## Task 4: Configure API policies (IP Filtering) and validate

In this task, you will create and use an API Management (APIM) policy for IP filtering. This policy will help you restrict access to your APIs by allowing only specified IP addresses. IP filtering adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that only trusted clients can access your services.

1. On the Azure Portal, use the search bar and search for **Virtual machines**, and then select **Virtual machines** under services.

   ![](media/ex3task5img8.png)

1. Select your **LabVM-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.From the overview page copy the **Public IP** adress and note it down, you will be using this IP in the further steps.

   ![](media/ex3task5imgat1.png)

1. Use the search bar in the Azure Portal, enter API Management services, and then select API Management services under Services.

   ![](media/ex3task5img1.png)

1. Select your **apiservice-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** service.

1. On the APIs page, Select **License-function-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** that you have added previously.

   ![](media/ex3task5img2.png)

1. On the **Design** pane. Find the **Inbound Processing** box and scroll down, click on **+Add policy**.

   ![](media/ex3task5img4.png)

1. On the **Add inbound policy** page. click on **Filter IP adresses** option.You will be navigated to **Inbound processing** page.

   There are multiple types of policies in API Management Service. Some major types are:

   1. **ip-filter** - it is used to allow or block a particular range of IP adresses.
   2. **rate-limit-by-key** - it is used to set a limit to number of API requests that a client can make.
   3. **validate JWT** - Enforces existence and validity of a JWT extracted from either a specified HTTP header, query parameter, or token value.

   for this task you will be using **ip-filter** policy.

   ![](media/ex3task5img5.png)

1. Scroll down and change the filtering to **Blocked IPs**(1). and click on **Add IP filter**(2).

   ![](media/ex3task5img6.png)

1. Add the IP adress of your **LabVM-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**, which you have copied in previously. Click on **save**.

   ![](media/ex3task5img7.png)

1. Now the policy will be added to your API, which restricts the access to your LabVM. To test this use the request URL which you have used in the previous task.

   Which looks similar to this:

   ```
   https://apiservice-1411123.azure-api.net/License-function-1411123/HttpTrigger1?id=7<ID>&subscription-key=<SUBSCRIPTION-KEY>
   ```
   >**Note**: Make sure to replace the `<ID>` and `<SUBSCRIPTION-KEY>` with the values you copies earlier.

1. Now paste the request URL in the new tab of your browser. You will see **403 Forbidden** error. Which means the policy is attached successfully which is blocking your IP address from accessing the API.

   ![](media/ex3task5img11.png)

1. Navigate back to your API's design pane and find the policy that you have attached previously in this task.

1. Click on 3 dots which is at the rightmost of your policy name. and click on **delete** to delete the policy.

   ![](media/ex3task5img12.png)

1. Click on **save** after deleting the policy.

   ![](media/ex3task5img13.png)

1. Now navigate back to the browser tab where you have pasted the request URL and refresh the page. Now you will be able to get the data successfully withut any error.

   ![](media/ex3task5img14.png)

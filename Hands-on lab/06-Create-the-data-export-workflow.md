# Exercise 6: Create the data export workflow

### Estimated Duration: 65 minutes

Here you will be using Azure Logic Apps which is a cloud-based service that enables you to automate workflows and integrate various services and applications. It provides a visual designer for building and managing workflows, making it easy to orchestrate complex processes without writing extensive code.

In this exercise, you'll develop a new Logic App to automate your data export workflow. This Logic App will be configured to execute on a scheduled basis, calling the ExportLicensePlates function to retrieve license plate data. The workflow includes a conditional logic step: if the function finds that there are no records to export, the Logic App will automatically send an email notification. This setup ensures that your team stays informed about the status of data exports, even when no new data is available, thereby streamlining communication and operational efficiency.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Finish ExportLicensePlates function code and publish it to function app
- Task 2: Configure the Logic App to export data
- Task 3: Verify the data export workflow

   ![TODO 5 is highlighted in the Visual Studio Task List.](media/visual-studio-task-list-todo-5.png "Task List")

1. In the DatabaseMethods.cs file that is opened, update the code on the line below the `TODO 5` comment, using the following code:

   ```
   // TODO 5: Retrieve a List of LicensePlateDataDocument objects from the collectionLink where the exported value is          false.
   licensePlates = _client.CreateDocumentQuery<LicensePlateDataDocument>(collectionLink,
        new FeedOptions() { EnableCrossPartitionQuery=true,MaxItemCount = 100 })
    .Where(l => l.exported == false)
    .ToList();
   ```

1. Next, return to the `TODO` list and double-click `TODO 6`.

   ![TODO 6 is highlighted in the Visual Studio Task List.](media/visual-studio-task-list-todo-6.png "Task List")

1. This is immediately below the `TODO 5` code you just updated. For this one, delete the line of code below the `// TODO 6` comment.

1. Make sure that you deleted the following line under `TODO 6`: `licensePlates = new List<LicensePlateDataDocument>();`.

1. Return to the TODO list and double-click TODO 7.

   ![TODO 7 is highlighted in the Visual Studio Task List.](media/visual-studio-task-list-todo-7.png "Task List")
